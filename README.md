# wordpress-ni-forms
A custom-built forms plugin for Wordpress

This was a from-the-ground-up rewrite of some custom forms plugins I've written for previous projects.
This is to be the base of future form plugins.

## Installing

This plugin is setup to use the GitHub Updater plugin to install and maintain updates:
